Pagers on non-AJAX forms are supported, with some magic.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Search, and most&nbsp;forms<\/strong>&nbsp;- You should not expect any publicly accessible form to work on your static site. It's static HTML, there's nowhere to POST! \ud83d\ude04It's recommended that these dynamic elements are moved to a PaaS service or DIY serverless function. A light-weight replacement for Search that works for small sites is in development, and will use client side fuzzy searching with Javascript.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Paragraphs&nbsp;<\/strong>- When a Paragraph is removed from a field, it is never actually deleted. This can lead to a lot of stale entities in&nbsp; your repository, which you would normally have to manually clean up. The \"Paragraphs Clean\" contributed module will delete Paragraphs when they are unreferenced. I use it on this site and it seems to work OK.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n",
