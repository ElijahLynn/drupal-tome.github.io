# The Tome Hompage - tome.fyi

Hello there! This is the repository for the Tome marketing and documentation
site, [tome.fyi](https://tome.fyi).

This site is also built with Tome, and should be editable on your local machine
if you want to see how it's made.

# Use

To install the site locally, run `drush tome:install`.

Once the site is installed, run `drush runserver`.

It's a pretty standard Drupal site! So poke around and have fun.

PRs for new documentation or fixes are more than welcome.
